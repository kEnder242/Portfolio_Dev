# Federated Lab Status: The "God View"
**Date:** Feb 8, 2026
**Scope:** Architecture, Bridges, and Public Infrastructure.

## 🧭 Navigation
*   **🧠 The Brain (Backend):** [HomeLabAI/ProjectStatus.md](../HomeLabAI/ProjectStatus.md)
*   **📂 The Face (Frontend):** [GEMINI.md](./GEMINI.md)

## 🎯 Active Initiative: "High-Fidelity Synthesis" (Phase 9)
**Goal:** Ground the AI archivist in 18 years of technical reality using test-time reasoning.
*   **v3.1.9 System [DONE]:**
    *   TTCS Reasoning Loop (Synthesize -> Solve).
    *   **Workbench UI:** Web Intercom with physical Report Writer sidebar and mobile sliding UI.
    *   **Subconscious Dreaming:** Multi-host memory consolidation pipeline (Linux -> Windows 4090).
    *   **3x3 CVT Builder:** Automated high-density career impact synthesis.
    *   **Curator Toolset:** Pinky tools for Lab Status, Vibe Checks, and Hallucination Pruning.
    *   **Liger-Kernel:** 80% VRAM reduction on Turing GPUs.
    *   **Continuous Burn [ACTIVE]:** Eternal background loop re-processing all notes and artifacts.
    *   **Research Hub:** New `research.html` dashboard tracking integrated papers.

## ✅ Global Milestones (Feb 2026)
1.  **Public Airlock (v3.1):** Deployed `www.jason-lab.dev` and secured notes.
2.  **Research Synthesis:** Created `RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS.md` mapping papers to implementation.
3.  **Diamond Synthesis:** Successfully completed first multi-host memory consolidation loop.
4.  **Portfolio Signature:** Deployed the 3x3 CVT Resume Builder.
5.  **Telemetry Box:** Implemented live narrative status on Timeline and Artifacts map.

## 🔮 The Roadmap
*   **[ACTIVE] Continuous Burn:** Indefinite refinement of technical gems.
*   **[TODO] Subconscious Dreaming:** Multi-host memory consolidation during idle cycles.
*   **[TODO] Web Intercom:** Add the "Report Writer" synthesis sidebar.
