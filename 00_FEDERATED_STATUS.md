**Date:** Feb 14, 2026
**Scope:** Architecture, Bridges, and Public Infrastructure.

## 🧭 Navigation
*   **🧠 The Brain (Backend):** [HomeLabAI/ProjectStatus.md](../HomeLabAI/ProjectStatus.md)
*   **📂 The Face (Frontend):** [GEMINI.md](./GEMINI.md)

## 🎯 Active Initiative: "Bicameral Dispatch" (Phase 9.5)
**Goal:** High-fidelity persona concurrency and strategic career matching.

## ✅ Global Milestones (Feb 2026)
1.  **Abstracted Silicon:** S/M/L model tiering and hardware-agnostic resilience ladder verified.
2.  **Safe Scalpel v3.0:** Lint-verified Unified Patching integrated across the Federated Mind.
3.  **Architectural Maturity:** Model-aware Liger-Kernels and non-blocking Silicon Hygiene verified.
4.  **Protocol Integrity:** Checkpoint, Co-Pilot, and Immutability rules codified and enforced.
5.  **Conscious Attendant:** Robust SIGTERM and VRAM budgeting via NVML verified.
6.  **Hierarchical Mind:** Architect Node verified and tiered Semantic Map generated.

## 🔮 The Roadmap
*   **[ACTIVE] Project "Resurrection" (Feb 14, 2026)**:
    *   **Goal:** Harden the Federated Mind through Abstraction and Stability.
    *   **Current Focus:** **Amygdala v3 (Contextual interjection logic).**
*   **[TODO] Phase 4: The Hierarchical Mind**: Connect Pinky as a **Consumer** of the Semantic Map.
*   **[TODO] Phase 5: Refined Persona**: Implement **Strategic Vibe Check** validation logic.
