*   **📂 The Face (Frontend):** [GEMINI.md](./GEMINI.md)

## 🎯 Active Initiative: "Bicameral Dispatch" (Phase 9.5)
**Goal:** High-fidelity persona concurrency and strategic career matching.

## ✅ Global Milestones (Feb 2026)
1.  **Unity Pattern Stabilized**: Unified the Lab nodes on Llama-3.2-3B-AWQ via vLLM with Liger kernels.
2.  **Silicon Headroom Verified**: Characterized 11GB VRAM budget with full stack + EarNode resident (~9.8GB peak).
3.  **Attendant Resilience**: Hardened Lab Attendant against zombie processes and non-blocking vLLM initialization.
4.  **Strategic Retrieval**: Connected Pinky to the 18-year archive via the Strategic Map integration.
5.  **Shadow Dispatch Prototype**: Integrated predictive intent detection into the transcription engine.

## 🔮 The Roadmap
*   **[ACTIVE] Unity Stabilization (v4.2)**:
    *   **Goal:** Harden the Unified Base and implement advanced sensory logic.
    *   **Current Focus:** **Amygdala v3 (Contextual interjection logic) & Shadow Dispatch.**
    *   **Scar (Feb 15 evening):**
        *   [HALT] System crash (z87) reported after Gauntlet run. Investigating OOM vs. Kernel Panic.
        *   [TODO] Hardened model resolution in `loader.py` pending verification after reboot.
        *   [TODO] Complete Phase 3 Barge-In verification and VRAM Heartbeat.
*   **[TODO] Phase 4: The Hierarchical Mind**: Connect Pinky as a **Consumer** of the Semantic Map.
*   **[TODO] Phase 5: Refined Persona**: Implement **Strategic Vibe Check** validation logic.
