# NEXT STEPS: Federated Lab Roadmap

## Active Sprint: Project Bladerunner (Identity & Silicon)
- [x] Restore Network Telemetry (Mbps alignment).
- [x] Enforce Iron Partition (Pinky vs. Architect identities).
- [x] Implement Bicameral Failover (Local fallback for Strategic queries).
- [x] Storage Optimization (Archives to HDD, HF Cache to SSD).

## vLLM Turing Resurrection Strategy (Feb 19 Update)
- [ ] **Action:** Force Driver 550-server. (Avoid 580 meta-package traps).
- [ ] **Action:** Re-attempt v0.4.2 build using Python 3.10 (3.12 is incompatible).
- [ ] **Finding:** Deadlock is confirmed as a V1 Engine / CUDA UVM conflict on Turing.
- [ ] **Finding:** Source builds on CUDA 13.0 fail early due to header mismatch.

## Phase 4: Semantic Map Integration
- [ ] Implement `build_semantic_map` tool logic in Archive node.
- [ ] Update Pinky to use semantic anchors for long-term retrieval.
- [ ] Stabilize "Dreaming" pipeline for nightly archive refinement.
