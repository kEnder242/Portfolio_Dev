# Feature Tracker: Acme Lab Bicameral Mind
**The DNA Association Matrix**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **PURPOSE:** This is a Relational Hub for mapping **Features** to **Code**, **Research**, and **Tests**.
> **NOT A MISSION DOC:** Refer to **[HomeLabAI/docs/ENGINEERING_PEDIGREE.md](../HomeLabAI/docs/ENGINEERING_PEDIGREE.md)** for the Strategic Mission and Architecture Laws.

## [ARTIFACT] Hardware Isolation Protocol
**Context:** Reversion artifact used during the "Driver 550 Resurgence."
**Mechanism:** Purge kernels, stop polling, and physically erase modules (e.g., `i2c_nvidia_gpu`).
**BKM:** Refer to `SESSION_BKM_FEB_19.md` for the "Undo" sequence if moving back to 580/Ampere.

## [FEAT-028] Strategic Ping (Generation Probe)
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Logic:** Functional Logic Verification verifying the *Mind* is alive (not just the process).
**Mechanism:** Single-token generation probe in `acme_lab.py` to trigger Brain-to-Shadow failover.

## [FEAT-031] Montana Protocol (Logger Isolation)
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Context:** Montana name was derived from original experience with a legacy project; implemented to manage logger hijacking by NeMo/ChromaDB.
**Logic:** Strictly isolates asynchronous library logs from the Lab Attendant's telemetry stream.

## [FEAT-030] vLLM Multi-LoRA Engine
**Status:** TABLED (Hardware Blocked)
**Note:** Physically untenable on Turing (2080 Ti). **RETAIN** code and configs for future Ampere+ upgrades.

## [BACKLOG] Synthesis & Forensic Tasks
1.  **[BACKLOG] Forensic Mapping**: Review Git/CLI history to map existing Scars to DNA.
2.  **[BACKLOG] Return to 580 Protocol**: Define the automated cleanup of isolation artifacts.
3.  **[BACKLOG] Strategic Ping Review**: Revisit timeouts and evaluate parallel heartbeat threads.
